# kopista
Simple minecraft mod that will introduce

* a new ore
* a new machine to process the ore
* a processed result
* a crafting recipe using the processed result for a new block
* a buff that the player gets when standing or walking on the crafted block

Basically this is a mod that will touch all major parts of Minecraft, to give me a playground for ideas.
